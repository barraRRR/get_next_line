When you walk through a storm
Hold your head up high
And don't be afraid of the dark
At the end of the storm
There's a golden sky
And the sweet silver song of a lark

Walk on
Through the wind
Walk on
Through the rain
Though your dreams be tossed and blown

Walk on
Walk on
With hope
In your heart
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never walk alone

Walk on
Walk on
With hope
In your heart
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never walk alone
